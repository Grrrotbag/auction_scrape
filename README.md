# Scraper

I wanted to test web scraping, and was asked how much all of the plant from an auction was valued at and thought it was kismet.

This is a *very* simple web scraper written in `python` which downloads all the items, on all 9 pages and puts the name and value together with a link to each item's details.

Requires the following packages:

- `requests`
- `beautiful soup`

Used pipenv to make a virtual environment so you can install dependencies from that if you wish.
